#### Dataset Updates

  - Addition of minor translations to the ATIS parser. Thanks to @zkaviator.
  - Amendment of DefaultJurisdiction to include better automatic sector ownership for TMAs.
  - Amended some procedures where an IAF was incorrectly entered as an IF. 
  - Amended some procedures where a mandatory fly-over fix had been entered, instead of a fly-by fix.

**Procedure Checker**

We have a new procedure checker, which cross-checks the procedures in the database against the promulgated Part 95 procedure sheets. Thanks to this, a few errors have been caught:

  - NZAA `UKAPA #D` STAR had the incorrect revision number.
  - Spelling error in the NZDN `AKLAR 2B` SID name.
  - Removal of the NZGS `CREEK`, `WARIK` and `OTOKO` STARs.
  - Reassigned the NZMO `GULAN 2` SID to both runways.
  - NZNP `BUGNO 1B` and `HARVO 1Q` had the incorrect revision number.
  - Spelling error in the NZNS `IDNEM 2P` SID name.
  - NZWP `BAYES` and `WYTAK` open SIDs had the incorrect revision number.
  - Removal of the NZWT SIDs.

**ENR and TMA Sector Bounds**

We have made the following changes to ENR sectors:

  - AA TMA: Added `DAVEE` TMA step on the border with RAN.
  - HN TMA: Realigned the eastern border to the RAN/BAY border, and extended further south.
  - OCR/RAN/BAY: Realigned border to better match surrounding ENRs and TMAs.
  - ENR and TMA sector maps updated.
  - Re-export of existing TMA and Procedural Tower bounds to produce a smoother arc (vertex every 5 degrees now.)
  - Slight realignment of the underlying Sector Volume definitions.

### Revision B

The `DefaultJurisdiction.xml` file intoduced in Cycle 2302 was faulting, causing aircraft tags on the ground at NZCH and NZQN to not appear in ADEP windows. We have rolled back to the previous version of this file.
