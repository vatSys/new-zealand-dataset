**Procedure Checker**

We have a new procedure checker, which cross-checks the procedures in the database against the promulgated Part 95 procedure sheets. Thanks to this, a few errors have been caught:

  - NZAA `UKAPA #D` STAR had the incorrect revision number.
  - Spelling error in the NZDN `AKLAR 2B` SID name.
  - Removal of the NZGS `CREEK`, `WARIK` and `OTOKO` STARs.
  - Reassigned the NZMO `GULAN 2` SID to both runways.
  - NZNP `BUGNO 1B` and `HARVO 1Q` had the incorrect revision number.
  - Spelling error in the NZNS `IDNEM 2P` SID name.
  - NZWP `BAYES` and `WYTAK` open SIDs had the incorrect revision number.
  - Removal of the NZWT SIDs.

**ENR and TMA Sector Bounds**

We have made the following changes to ENR sectors:

  - AA TMA: Added `DAVEE` TMA step on the border with RAN.
  - HN TMA: Realigned the eastern border to the RAN/BAY border, and extended further south.
  - OCR/RAN/BAY: Realigned border to better match surrounding ENRs and TMAs.
  - ENR and TMA sector maps updated.
