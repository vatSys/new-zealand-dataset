## AIRAC 2201

### Revision A

#### Dataset Updates

- **fix**: Palmerston North Tower/Ground has been renamed to "Palmerston Tower/Ground".
- **fix**: `LUBS3C` renamed to `LUBS2C`. 
- **feat**: Small changes to our Sector export logic in support of a future update. Because of this, the `NSFA`, `NTTT`, `NZCM` and `NZZO` FIRs are no longer shown in the domestic dataset.

### Revision B

Fix relating to the NZOH Boundary in `ENR Sectors.xml`.

### Revision C

Re-release to ensure that the changes carry through.

## AIRAC 2202

### Revision A

#### ANR Updates

- Addition of the `GOBIN`, `IGOBA` `OMGOV` IFR waypoints.
- Removal of the `DAKUR`, `LUKLO` and `NUBKA` IFR waypoints.
- Addition of Hamilton Delivery, with frequency 122.900.


**Rotorua**:
  - Some STARs have been renumbered.
  - Some approach waypoints that have previously been procedural waypoints, have been replaced by IFR waypoints. 

**Christchurch**:
  - Some waypoints on the GNSS approaches have been replaced. There are no changes to the route the approach takes.

- Amendment to the VFR East arrivals at NZHN.

#### Dataset Updates

- **fix**: Slight change in how we notate and program procedures within the SFG app. This has caused:
  - Approaches to be re-labelled `RNP` and `RNP-AR`, instead of `GNSS` and `RNP`.
  - Threshold fixes for SIDs and Approaches are now handled automatically by the SFG.
- **feat**: Heliports have been added to the dataset.
- **fix**: Duplicate co-ordinates from Airspace definitions have been removed.
- **feat**: SFG now has support for drawing multiple Enroute holds at a single IFR significant point.
- **feat**: Dataset now contains all Pacific Ocean position definitions for liaision, in preparation for the Combined Oceanic Dataset.
- **feat**: Addition of NZNS_DEL on 123.3.

#### Position Changes

Some minor changes to Hamilton positions this cycle. NZHN-R_TWR has been removed, as it has only every been staffed six times. This has allowed for the reallocation of 126.8 as NZHN_TWR's new primary frequency. 

Hamilton also gains a Delivery frequency this cycle, with a frequency of 122.900, which was previously assigned to NZHN_TWR. This delivery station is a Secondary position - so can be staffed only if Hamilton Tower is online, much the same as NZHN_APP.

Nelson Delivery has also been added to the network. This works in much the same way as Hamilton Delivery, and can only be staffed if Nelson Tower is online.

#### Other changes

There have been some significant changes to the Sector File Generator tool this past month or so, enabling some neat data to come through in the next couple of cycles. 

### Revision B

This revision fixes some Auckland SID resequencing that was missed in Revision A. 


## AIRAC 2203

### Revision A

#### ANR Updates

There aren't any changes in the ANR this cycle.

#### Dataset Updates

- **fix**: RNP approaches now no longer appear in both the `RNP` and `RNP-AR` map layers - only the `RNP` layer. 
  - This also extends to each aerodrome's individual approach map layers.
- **fix**: (SFG) Removed Threshold fixes from RNP and RNP-AR approaches. This is now performed automatically by the SFG.
- **fix**: (SFG) Fixed a bug that meant that some `RNP` approaches weren't being rendered in the `RNP` layer, in addition to the Aerodrome folder's RNP map layers. These now show up.


## AIRAC 2204

### Revision A

#### ANR Updates

- Slight amendments to the FAF for RNAV Z, both RWY 05R/23L.

#### ANR Update

**Visual Reporting Points (VRPs)**

  - The following VRPs have been established:  Wainui Shed, Red Horn, Sadler Point, Gulf Harbour Marina, Albany Stadium, Cow Sheds, Mackenzie Pass, Glendhu Bay, Cardrona Pines, Queensberry Ponds, Albert Town Bridge and Mou Waho.
