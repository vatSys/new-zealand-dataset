#### **Other Changes**

* Napier ATIS frequency updated to the correct frequency of `128.000MHz`.
* Additon of NZFI Ground Radar view. This can be found under Class G Aerodromes. 
* Minor back-end fix to the Woodbourne ground view.
* `Auckland Control (Raglan Sector)` now has its own Enroute display.
* Added a Map layer with all TMA Sectors - `Maps > Airspace > TMA Sectors`. (Note: These don't always line-up with Enroute Sector lines, and Enroute Sectors will be redefined in an upcoming AIRAC).
* Added a Map layer with all Procedural Towers - `Maps > Airspace > Procedural Towers`.

#### **Connection Window**

Users can now select different Tower or Approach units through a dropdown in the connection dialog box. To find these, select the next highest control center's view and go into the connection dialog. You can now click the dropdown and select different ATS units.

For example - to select Auckland Tower, open the Auckland TMA view by navigating to `Positions > ACU > Auckland ACU`. When you open the Connection dialog box, you will be given the option for the following Towers:

<center>
  <img src="assets/connectionDialogApp.png" width="500" style="padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 15px;" />
</center>

But what if you want to control Tauranga Tower? Open the Bay Approach Enroute view by navigating to `Positions > Enroute > Bay Approach`. When you open the dialog box, you will be given the option for the following Towers:

<center>
  <img src="assets/connectionDialogEnr.png" width="500" style="padding-top: 15px; padding-bottom: 15px;" />
</center>

Procedural Towers will be getting their own Position definitions next AIRAC, so be on the lookout for that!

## AIRAC 2110

### Revision A (Initial)

Minor changes to the dataset this month as it is a non-major amendment month.

#### **ANR Updates**

* Removal of `NZSL` as an IFR-VFR AD. The associated IFR procedures have been withdrawn.
* Addition of the `AVNEM`, `IGOVU`, `LIDGA`, `OLVOL`, `OPEKU`, `UGSAP` and `VETUM` IFR fixes.

* Addition of VATPAC Oceanic Stations.
* Minor updating of QN RNPs.
* Fixed DefaultSector definitions. Superior sectors should now properly inherit subordinate sectors, in additon to PP FIS now being linked to a defined Sector volume.
* Slight re-organisation of Map layers. `ATS Routes` can now be found under `Navaids`.
* Addition of Enroute Holding Patterns and IFR Waypoint map layers. See the below heading.

#### **Procedural Towers**

All of the Procedural Towers now have their own ACU view, which can be selected through the `Positions > Procedural Tower` menu. The Procedural Tower `ControllerInfo` definitions added in the previous AIRAC have been removed.

#### **Enroute Holds**

All Enroute Holds have been added under `Maps > Navaids`. The label stemming from the Solid Triangle is the holding waypoint. Within the racetrack are two other datalines - `XXX L/R` and `YYYY`. 

* In `XXX L/R`, the `XXX` is the inbound heading of the hold. Either `L` or `R` is shown next to it, to denote whether it is a left or right turn holding pattern. 
* `YYYY` denotes the minimum holding altitude, typically based on MSA or airspace/traffic containment.

#### **Dataset Updates**

The following procedures have been redesignated:
  * **NZAA**
    * `EXOPI 9B` -> `EXOPI 1B`
    * `BASIV 8B` -> `BASIV 9B`

    * `UKAPA 1D` -> `UKAPA 2D`
    * `SCARY 1B` -> `SCARY 2B`
    * `PEPPE 4B` -> `PEPPE 5B`
    * `NOBAR 7B` -> `NOBAR 8B`
    * `DAVEE 5D` -> `DAVEE 6D`
    * `PEPPE 7D` -> `PEPPE 8D`

  * **NZGS**
    * `POPAD 1` -> `POPAD 2`
    * `NODEX 1` -> `NODEX 2`

#### **VSCS Plugin**

A new VSCS plugin has been added to the Dataset, enabling the Controller to open and control their VSCS panel through a web interface. 

This plugin opens a local webserver that allows you to access the interface either through your host machine, or through a mobile device on the same local network. The webserver is hosted on the local machine through port `7673`. This means that on your local machine, you can type `localhost:7673` into your web browser to find the interface. To access the interface through a networked device, the local machine's local IP address should be used instead of `localhost`. 

Special thanks to Zach from VATPAC and Jake from vatSys for working on the plugin. The styles for the plugin have been slightly adjusted for use with the VATNZ dataset. The project data respository [can be found here](https://github.com/vatSys/RemoteVSCSPlugin).

### Revision B (Bug Fixing)

The VSCS Plugin released as a part of 2111 Revision A has been withdrawn, as it is causing a crashing issue when switching between datasets.

The NZ customised version of the plugin will be available in the future for download, once some additional bugs have been squashed.

## AIRAC 2201

### Revision A (Initial)

Very small update this cycle, as there hasn't been many changes to the AIP. Most of the effort has been put into an upcoming major project.

#### **ANR Updates**

There aren't any changes in the ANR this cycle.

*Note*: The closure of Loburn Abbey (NZLA) will be amended into the AIP in Cycle 2202.

#### **Dataset Updates**

* **fix**: Palmerston North Tower/Ground has been renamed to "Palmerston Tower/Ground".
* **fix**: `LUBS3C` renamed to `LUBS2C`. 
* **feat**: Small changes to our Sector export logic in support of a future update. Because of this, the `NSFA`, `NTTT`, `NZCM` and `NZZO` FIRs are no longer shown in the domestic dataset.

### Revision B

Fix relating to the NZOH Boundary in `ENR Sectors.xml`.

### Revision C

Re-release to ensure that the changes carry through.

## AIRAC 2202

### Revision A (Initial)

#### **ANR Updates**

* Addition of the `GOBIN`, `IGOBA` `OMGOV` IFR waypoints.
* Removal of the `DAKUR`, `LUKLO` and `NUBKA` IFR waypoints.
* Addition of Hamilton Delivery, with frequency 122.900.
* **Rotorua**:
  * Some STARs have been renumbered.
  * Some approach waypoints that have previously been procedural waypoints, have been replaced by IFR waypoints. 
* **Christchurch**:
  * Some waypoints on the GNSS approaches have been replaced. There are no changes to the route the approach takes.
* Amendment to the VFR East arrivals at NZHN.

#### **Dataset Updates**

* **fix**: Slight change in how we notate and program procedures within the SFG app. This has caused:
  * Approaches to be re-labelled `RNP` and `RNP-AR`, instead of `GNSS` and `RNP`.
  * Threshold fixes for SIDs and Approaches are now handled automatically by the SFG.
* **feat**: Heliports have been added to the dataset.
* **fix**: Duplicate co-ordinates from Airspace definitions have been removed.
* **feat**: SFG now has support for drawing multiple Enroute holds at a single IFR significant point.
* **feat**: Dataset now contains all Pacific Ocean position definitions for liaision, in preparation for the Combined Oceanic Dataset.
* **feat**: Addition of NZNS_DEL on 123.3.

#### Position Changes

Some minor changes to Hamilton positions this cycle. NZHN-R_TWR has been removed, as it has only every been staffed six times. This has allowed for the reallocation of 126.8 as NZHN_TWR's new primary frequency. 

Hamilton also gains a Delivery frequency this cycle, with a frequency of 122.900, which was previously assigned to NZHN_TWR. This delivery station is a Secondary position - so can be staffed only if Hamilton Tower is online, much the same as NZHN_APP.

Nelson Delivery has also been added to the network. This works in much the same way as Hamilton Delivery, and can only be staffed if Nelson Tower is online.

#### Other changes

There have been some significant changes to the Sector File Generator tool this past month or so, enabling some neat data to come through in the next couple of cycles. 

### Revision B

This revision fixes some Auckland SID resequencing that was missed in Revision A. 


## AIRAC 2203
